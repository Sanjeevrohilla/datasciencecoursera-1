## About Project
The project consists of two parts:

1.A simulation exercise. (SimulationExercise.Rmd)
2.Basic inferential data analysis. (ToothGrowth.Rmd)


## Assignment

PART 1 :

In this part, the exponential distribution in R is investigated and compared with the Central Limit Theorem

Steps:
1.Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2.Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3.Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

PART 2 :

Now in the second portion of the project,the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package is analysed.

Steps:
1.Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
2.Provide a basic summary of the data.
3.Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
4.State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
